# Esolang Adventures

🐱‍👤 Fairly mind-boggling programs coded in various equally mind-boggling esoteric languages. I was very happy and stress-free, so I decided some torture is obviously needed in my life. Here I will try to dabble in esoteric languages like Brainfuck, L33T, Cow, PIET, JSFuck, and the likes.

### What are esoteric languages?

A programming language that is created for fun, for code obfuscation or as an experiment in simply pushing the boundaries of programming. Too often, esoteric languages are developed by **people with far too much time on their hands**. For example, the code in the Piet language looks like an abstract art image that is compiled by moving a pointer from one colored region to the next. Whitespace uses commands comprising only combinations of spaces, tabs and line feeds. JSFuck is JavaScript code entirely converted into these six characters [ ] ( ) ! + and no others. 


### Hello World in Brainfuck

```brainfuck
++++++++++[>+++++++>++++++++++>+++>+<<<<-]>++.>+.+++++++..+++.>++.<<+++++++++++++++.>.+++.------.--------.>+.>.
```

How the fuck does Brainfuck work? I have no clue, but maybe [this guy](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16836860/how-does-the-brainfuck-hello-world-actually-work) does.
