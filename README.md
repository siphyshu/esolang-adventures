# Esolang Adventures

👨‍💻 This repository is the home of my esolang adventures at various points in time throughout my career. I call them 'adventures' because fiddling around with esoteric languages is not less than one. It's a bloody roller coaster ride - one moment you think you understand the 8 simple commands in the language, then the next moment you're pulling your hairs and bawling your eyes out trying to figure out how to implement a simple for loop. Fun stuff truly.

### What are esoteric languages?

A programming language that is created for fun, for code obfuscation or as an experiment in simply pushing the boundaries of programming. Too often, esoteric languages are developed by **people with far too much time on their hands**. For example, the code in the Piet language looks like an abstract art image that is compiled by moving a pointer from one colored region to the next. Whitespace uses commands comprising only combinations of spaces, tabs and line feeds. JSF**k is JavaScript code entirely converted into these six characters [ ] ( ) ! + and no others. You get the gist.


### Hello World in Brainf**k

```brainfuck
++++++++++[>+++++++>++++++++++>+++>+<<<<-]>++.>+.+++++++..+++.>++.<<+++++++++++++++.>.+++.------.--------.>+.>.
```

How the heck does Brainf**k work? I have no clue, but maybe [this guy](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16836860/how-does-the-brainfuck-hello-world-actually-work) does.

### Programming is an Art, literally

All of these images are actually hello world programs written in [PIET](https://esolangs.org/wiki/piet) language.
